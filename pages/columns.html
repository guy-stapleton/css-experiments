                <p>His suitability for the role of CTO, then, rests largely on his business CV, which is where a lot of the complaints
                seem to come from. “I don’t think Derek Handley’s success is at all attributable to a talent in tech,” said Ben
                Gracewood, head of engineering at Vend.</p>
                <p>“Handley would be a surprising, perhaps polarising choice,” said Lance Wiggs, a tech investor and founder of the
                Punakaiki Fund. “His background does not show the sorts of experiences that would impress the IT industry, as it seems
                focused on branding and marketing rather than building reliable sustainable enterprise systems … His selection could
                create controversy from investors in companies he has founded that subsequently floundered or failed.”</p>
                <p>A well-credentialed CTO characterises Handley’s career thus: “He’s founded two ad agencies – he’s not a technologist as
                far as I can tell.”</p>
                <p>His assistant tells me he is working as “Chief Innovation Officer with New York-based social impact startup studio,
                Human Ventures, co-founding industry-changing ventures alongside exceptional entrepreneurs” at present. But Handley’s
                most relevant professional CV highlights are a pair of mobile companies, Hyperfactory, which he ran for most of his
                twenties, and Snakk Media. The former was founded in 2001 and acquired by Meredith, the American women’s magazine giant
                in 2010 for an undisclosed sum (the NBR’s Chris Keall made an educated stab at US$22.5m); the Hyperfactory domain now
                leads to MXM, a division of consultancy Accenture, while its Facebook is delisted and Twitter account suspended.</p>
                <p>Snakk Media is a mobile advertising company which listed on the New Zealand alternative exchange in 2013, transferring
                to the NXT in 2015, the same year Handley stepped down as chairman (reporting at the time said he retained a 15% stake
                though he is not listed among the 20 largest current shareholders).</p>
                <p>Snakk’s most recent annual report describes a perilous position. “The level of working capital available is very tight
                limiting opportunities and placing pressure on the business overall,” it reads. “Snakk’s scale of operations is low for
                a listed company.” Its current market capitalisation says it’s worth just over $800,000, which surely disappoints those
                who participated in a $6.5m investment round in 2013.</p>
                <p>Which is to say that one of his two main businesses achieved a successful exit but now appears to have vanished, while
                another limps along. His most high profile directorship has been that of Sky TV, which has taken a sharemarket pounding
                these last few years, in large part due to its failure to adapt to the digital environment. Sky Go in particular is
                perhaps New Zealand’s most complained-about piece of digital infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Speaking to a number of different tech luminaries, most of whom asked that their quotes not be attributed to them due
                to the tight-knit nature of the community, there was an overwhelming sense of bemusement at his apparently imminent
                appointment.</p>
